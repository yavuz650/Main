# Snake-Game

The good-old snake game for Linux. Frankly,the main goal here was to practice coding. 

**What are the current features?**

-Basic snake movement.
-Collision detection.
-Food generation and growth.

**How can I try it?**

Compile the code in your Linux terminal using the following command.(Assuming you have g++ compiler installed)

```g++ -main.cpp Engine.cpp -o snake -lncurses -pthread```

Then run by executing the command below.

```./snake```

**RULES**

Don't collide with the walls.
Don't collide with the snake itself.
